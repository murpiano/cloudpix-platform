# The backend

My World runs without one: every archive stays in the browser of the person who made it. With a
[Supabase](https://supabase.com) project behind it, the same app gets accounts, an archive kept
on any device, and photos in a private bucket. Nothing in the app changes but where things are
kept (`src/data/remote-repository.ts` instead of `local-repository.ts`).

The app is built for one or the other: with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` set it
uses the project; without them it stays local. Both values are public by design: what protects
the data is row level security in the database, set up by the migration below.

## What is stored

| Where | What | Who can touch it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth.users` | email, password hash, `user_metadata` (name, home base) | the account itself |
| `public.archives` | one row per account: the archive as one JSON document | its owner only (RLS) |
| bucket `photos` | `<account id>/<photo id>`: the photo files, private | its owner only (RLS) |

## Set it up

1. Make a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (the free plan is enough to start).
2. Run [the migration](migrations/20260930000000_init.sql): open **SQL Editor**, paste it, run.
   (Or with the CLI: `npx supabase link --project-ref <ref>` and `npx supabase db push`.)
3. **Authentication → Providers → Email**: for a first test, switch **Confirm email** off, so an
   account works at once. The free plan sends only a few confirmation emails an hour; before
   opening the app to people, set up an SMTP service under **Authentication → SMTP** and switch
   confirmation back on.
4. **Authentication → URL Configuration**: set **Site URL** to `https://murpiano.github.io/my-world/`
   (and add `http://127.0.0.1:3001` to the redirect URLs for local work).
5. **Project Settings → API**: copy the **Project URL** and the **anon public** key.
6. For the live site: in the GitHub repository, **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
   Variables**, add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` with those two values. The next push to
   `main` builds the app with them.
7. For local work: copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env.local`, fill it in, `npm run dev`.

Never put the **service_role** key anywhere in this repository or in the page.

## Limits to know

- The free plan has about 1 GB of file storage and 500 MB of database, and pauses a project after
  a week without requests. A photo is about 300–400 KB after the app resizes it.
- An edit replaces the whole archive document; two devices editing at once, the last save wins.
- Deleting an account itself (not just its data) needs a server-side function and is not built:
  "Reset archive to the demo" in the account settings deletes the archive and every photo.
