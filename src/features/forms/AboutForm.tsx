            No cookies, no analytics, no ads, no tracking. There is no server: what you add while
            logged in — your name, trips, albums and photos — stays in this browser only, in local
            storage, and never leaves your device. You can download a backup of it in the account
            settings. The fonts are served from this site itself, so no other company sees your visit.

          <p>
            My World is a personal project, offered as it is, without any warranty. Likes and
            comments are demo stubs. Clearing the site data deletes your archive, so keep your own
            copies of the photos.
